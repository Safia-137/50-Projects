        <p>Minions are small, yellow, cylindrical characters from the *Despicable Me* movie franchise. They serve as loyal, yet comically inept, henchmen for the villain Gru. Their playful and mischievous behavior, combined with their unique language (Minionese), makes them highly entertaining. Minions are known for their slapstick humor, love of bananas, and their childlike curiosity. Although they are meant to assist Gru in his villainous plans, they often cause chaos due to their clumsy actions. Their design, simple but memorable, has contributed to their immense popularity in global pop culture.</p>
